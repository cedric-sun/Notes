Argument
==========

In this argument, the arguer recommends/suggests that ....
To support this conclusion, the arguer cites the result of a recent survey that ....
Moreover the arguer points out that ....
As it stands, the argument suffers from several critical/fatal/crucial flaws as follows. 

First of all,the arguer fails to convince us of the validity of several data cited in ...

In addtion,the auguer commits a fallacy of oversimplification. As we all know, there are several major factors contribute ...

Finally,the argument per se is based on a gratiutous assumption that .... 

To sum up,the conclusion reached in the argument lacks credibility since the evidence cited in the analysis does not lend strong support to what the arguer claims.
To make the argument more convincing, the arguer should provide more information concerning ....

To better evaluate the argument, we need more concrete evidence that ..., otherwise the argument is logically unacceptable.

------------------------------------------

1.A gruondless survey/study 
	The validity of the survy is open to doubt. 
	The survey lacks representativeness... 
	There is no specific information about the survy... 
	Without knowing how the survey was done, how it represents the public opnion ...
	Who conducted the survy? Who responded? How the poll was conducted? 
	The opinon lacks representativeness of overall attitudes based on which we can make any general judgement about the conclusion.... 
	In absence of specific information about the survey, it’s impossible for us to evaluate the argument. 

2.Oversimplification 
	The arguer commits a fallacy of oversimplification. 
	There are several major factors contribute to the XXX other than YYY ,such as/for instance ZZZ, all of which are ignored by the arguer. 
	As we know ,XXX depends on many factors ,such as ZZZ, which are unknown from the argument. 
	The arguer fails to establish a causal relationship between XXX and YYY. 
	For example ,YYY may also help explain XXX. 
	Factors such as AA and BB both have some bearing on XXX. 
	Actually,the recommendation(提议，意见) that YYYY as the only way to XXX most likely turn out to be ineffective and somewhat misleading. 

3.A false analogy 
	The argument is based on a false analogy. 
	Even though there are some points of comparison between XX and YY,there are dissimilarities as well. 
	But the problem is that the two situation are not similar enough to justify the analogical deduction. 
	# As we know,the struction, system, operation are conspicously different. 
	It’s a incomplete and selective comparison. 
	Even though XX is proved effective in YYY,there is no guarantee that it will just work as well in ZZZ. 

4.A gratuitous assumption 
	The argument is based on a gratuitous assumption that ####, which is, of course unwarranted. 
	The arguer fails to convince us that.... 

5.A false dilemma 
	The arguer unfairly assumes that we must make an either/or choice between XX and YY. 
	XX and YY are not necessarily mutually-exclusive alternatives. 
	Adjusting XX and YY together might produce a better result. 

6.A hasty generalization 
	We are informed that XXX, but we do not know whether all of ### prefer ###. 
	We can believe that XXX is indeed ###, but based on this slim information
	we can never evaluate the overall performance of YYY. 

7.A fallacy of "after this ,therfore bacause of this" 
	The arguer unfairly assumes that XXX caused YYY,since many other reasons may explain that ###. 
	Unless other possiblities have be considered and ruled out ,the conclusion is unconvicing. 

8.All things are equal. 
	The arguer commits a fallacy of "all things are equal". 
	The arguer assumes without justification that the background condtions have remained the same at different time and different places.
