Feature Request
----------------------
1. Go back normal mode after yanking in visual mode.
2. Put cursor at the position specified by hint sequence when entering visual mode.
3. Support `Nw` or `Nb` in caret mode and visual mode where `N` is a number.


Desires, not sure whether they are viable or logically not ambiguous.
----------------------
1. Highlight `/` or `?` search result on scroll bar just like the native Chrome `Ctrl-F` does.
2. Jump (back) to the first `/` or `?` search result.


Known (dubious) problem
----------------------
1. `q` fails to trigger hover event.
2. `zr` fails to restart Chrome.
3. `P` fails to handle multiple lines URLs without protocol prefixes.
4. Cannot `map <C-[> previousTab`, but `map <C-]> nextTab` works.
5. Input method is able to change the content of page in caret mode.


Dingus
----------------------
what does gh gl mean
key '#' reset the scroll focus to the main page: what m1
; what does it mean by 'change the link hint focus'?
'' go to last scroll position : what does it mean
<C-o> <C-i>: add explanation that which operations will modify the jump list(i.e. a more specific doc?)
mnemonic annotation in doc?
